# Outbound-Blocker
Uses the Windows Firewall API (which is implemented from Windows Vista onwards) and netsh to allow you to easily block (and subsequently unblock) outbound traffic for a specified application.

Inspiration for this is credited to Rockstar dealing out GTAV multiplayer bans for singleplayer mods

Pre-compiled binary is available [here](https://bitbucket.org/5OClockCharlie/outbound-blocker/downloads/Outbound%20Blocker.exe),
though I would recommend that you download the zip and look over / compile it yourself, so as to ensure the legitimacy / non-
maliciousness of the performed functions.
